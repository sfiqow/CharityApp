Universal giving

This app uses Supabase as its database for managing users charity information, allowing them to create, read, update, and delete their data and charity information. Additionally, it stores users email address
and password for authentication purposes. As well as using UI controls such as VerticalStackLayout, HorizontalStackLayout, GridLayout, FlexLayout, ScrollView, CollectionView and Flyout tabs for better 
user experience. The app also has various software design patterns, including Dependency Injection for managing view models and services, Behavioral design patterns such as the Observer pattern for 
handling state changes, and the MVVM architectural pattern for separating concerns between the UI and business logic, among others. These patterns contribute to a more scalable application design.
